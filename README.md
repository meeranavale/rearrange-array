# Problem Statment:
Rearrange the elements in the array such that even positioned elements are greater than odd positioned elements

# Approach:
Traverse the array from the second element and swap the element with the previous one if the condition is not satisfied

# Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
